Using django-boxes
==================


Basics
------

To integrate ``django-boxes`` with your site, there are a few things
that are required.  A minimal integration can work like this:

1.  List this application in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` portion of your settings
    file.  Your settings file will look something like::
   
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            # ...
            "boxes",
        )

2.  Add the ``boxes`` urls to the end of your root urlconf.  Your urlconf
    will look something like::
    
        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            # ...
            (r"^admin/(.*)", admin.site.root),
            (r"^boxes/", include("boxes.urls")),
        )

3.  Add two templates under ``templates/boxes/``. One called ``refresh.html``
    that has nothing in context and the other, ``box_edit.html`` that has a
    ``form`` variable in context.

4.  Wherever you want to display a content box::
    
        {% load boxes_tags %}
    
    Then, use the ``box`` tag to display the content in addition to edit
    links if authorized::
    
        {% box label [*args **kwargs] %}
    
    WHere the ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are passed to the authorizatoin function,
    if not supplied no edit link will ever appear.
