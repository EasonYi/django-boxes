Configuration
=============

There is one optional ``settings.py`` constant and that is ``BOXES_CAN_EDIT_CALLABLE``
which you set to a string to the full import path of a callable in your project
that takes ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` and return a ``boolean`` on whether or not
to allow editing of the box via front-end.
