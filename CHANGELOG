Notes
*****

* Migrations.
  
  Box model (added created_by and last_updated_by columns as FK to
  User). It also includes a new model, Revision::
  
    ALTER TABLE "boxes_box" ADD COLUMN "created_by_id" integer not null REFERENCES "auth_user" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
    ALTER TABLE "boxes_box" ADD COLUMN "last_updated_by_id" integer not null REFERENCES "auth_user" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
    
    CREATE TABLE "boxes_revision" (
        "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        "box_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "boxes_box" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
        "label" varchar(100) NOT NULL,
        "content" text NOT NULL,
        "orig_created_by_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "auth_user" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED,
        "created_on" timestamp with time zone NOT NULL,
        "created_by_id" integer NOT NULL REFERENCES "auth_user" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
    );
    
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_box_created_by_id" ON "boxes_box" ("created_by_id");
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_box_last_updated_by_id" ON "boxes_box" ("last_updated_by_id");
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_revision_box_id" ON "boxes_revision" ("box_id");
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_revision_label" ON "boxes_revision" ("label");
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_revision_label_like" ON "boxes_revision" ("label" varchar_pattern_ops);
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_revision_orig_created_by_id" ON "boxes_revision" ("orig_created_by_id");
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_revision_created_by_id" ON "boxes_revision" ("created_by_id");

* Templates.
  
  A ``boxes/box_create.html`` was added that can be identical to ``boxes/box_edit.html``
  just with a different action url.

* Urls.
  
  A new ``boxes_create`` url was added to support the rendering of the create
  form as well as processing the POST of that form. It takes a ``[-\w]+`` parameter
  which is the label.
