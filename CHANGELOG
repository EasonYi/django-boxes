* Migrations.
  
  Box model (added created_by and last_updated_by columns as FK to
  User). It also includes a new model, Revision::
  
    ALTER TABLE "boxes_box" ADD COLUMN "created_by_id" integer not null REFERENCES "auth_user" ("id") DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED;
    CREATE INDEX "boxes_box_created_by_id" ON "boxes_box" ("created_by_id");

* Templates.
  
  A ``boxes/box_create.html`` was added that can be identical to ``boxes/box_edit.html``
  just with a different action url.

* URLs.
  
  A new ``boxes_create`` url was added to support the rendering of the create
  form as well as processing the POST of that form. It takes a ``[-\w]+`` parameter
  which is the label.
